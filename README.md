# Hello Folks!<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">



My name is yao, I am currently a master student in the Quantitative method in social sciences program. I had several past internships that in the field of consulting and investment, and most work I have done were to analyze and visualize the financial performance data also customer surveys of the targeted company to support the deal or the due diligence. I really enjoy the process of digging into problem to find the root cause for example in a due diligence project I have participated in, I analyzed what contribute to the growth or recession from product category to the specific stock keeping unit. So data seemed to attract me internships since my it can not only identify patterns which can recognize new market opportunity but also can impact the decision making within the business. Therefore I choose to go to QMSS program to learn more advanced data tools like python and r and to enter the data world
